This is my personal project. Plans are to keep building off of it and add more functionality with an emphasis on CI/CD/DevOps practices and tools.
Behind this project I've also added bootstrap scripts/bash scripts to initialize my EC2 with docker,jenkins, and java.

Next steps is to experiment with Terraform and AWS SDK's to learn IaC.
